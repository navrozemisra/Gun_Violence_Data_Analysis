The article provides 17 maps and charts that represent various aspects of Gun ownership in United States. <br> \n",

    "In the [article on Vox's website](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts), chart 5 depicts the relationship between gun ownership and gun deaths across states in USA. The chart was created using 2013 data for gun ownership and gun deaths. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have more recent data (upto March 2018), we were interested in exploring this relationship with gun ownership data for a later time period. We found [2017 gun ownership by state](https://www.thoughtco.com/gun-owners-percentage-of-state-populations-3325153) as compiled by the website [HuntingMark.com](https://huntingmark.com/gun-ownership-stats/#_ftn1%20). The data on this website is taken from ATF (United States Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) report on [Firearm Commerce in the United States, 2017 statistics](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/undefined/firearms-commerce-united-states-annual-statistical-update-2017/download) **Exhibit 8** on **National Firearms Act Registered Weapons by State (April 2017)** which lists the number of registered guns by state.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the actual number of guns might be much more than the numbers depicted here since United States does not have a regulation in place for registration of all guns. But this is the most reliable, if any, data source available to us on gun ownership so we decided to use this for our analysis.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis I found that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suicides contribute to 70% of the total deaths that occur due to gun violence incidents across United States**\n",
    "\n",
    "I analyzed three causes of deaths due to gun violence incidents- suicidal deaths, accidental deaths & mass shooting deaths. We observed that over the time-period of our analysis (2014-2017), suicides comprise nearly two-thirds of all gun violence related deaths. I also saw that suicides are the leading cause of death from gun violence incidents across all states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important finding becase gun violence related incidents gather public and media attention only when a mass shooting occurs in US. However, in our analysis I found that 70% of deaths due to gun violence incidents are suicides, and they are almost never a part of the public debate. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Increase in gun ownership rates leads to increase in likelihood of deaths by suicides**\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that increase in gun ownership rate from 0% to 1% results in an increase in the number of average deaths by suicides by ~170%. Increase in gun ownership also increases likelihood of accidental death by over 1000%. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important finding because guns are often advertised and believed to be a means of protection and safety in US, but we clearly see that with increase in gun ownership rates, there is an increase in number of deaths- accidental or suicide. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restrictive laws do have an impact on suicides using guns. Increasing restrictive gun laws can reduce suicide deaths from gun violence incidents**\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue of gun violence is extremely complicated and varied across state laws and local culture. Many states support that strict firearm regulation is a necessary measure in preventing and reducing gun deaths; however, many other states do not take this stance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could see that states with strict gun policies have fewer instances of suicide deaths when compared to states with lenient gun policies.\n",
    "This implies that restrictive laws are an important force that can help reduce number of suicide deaths across states.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, from my analysis, it is evident that suicides are the leading cause of deaths from gun violence incidents and increase in gun ownership rate leads to increase in number of suicide deaths. However, states can introduce more restrictive laws to help reduce incidents of suicides.\n"
